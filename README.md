A practice exacercise project for learning AutoMapper

AutoMapper is a powerful object-to-object mapping library in .NET. It simplifies the process of mapping data from one object type to another, which is particularly useful when dealing with complex models or data transfer objects (DTOs).

Key Features:
*Convention-Based Mapping: AutoMapper automatically maps properties that have the same name and type.
*Custom Mappings: AutoMapper can define custom mappings when properties donâ€™t match directly.
*Projection: AutoMapper can project complex data models to simpler DTOs for API responses.
*Flattening: It allows to map hierarchical structures into single-layered models.
